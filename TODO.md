# TODO

## Plugins view 

- customised plug-in loader/scanner

- z/x to zoom in and out of selection
- fix triplets
- track zoom/scroll
- double click on curved path to straiten

## Parameters View

- searchable parameters list

## UI

- add build info

## Features

- maybe random should sample from [-1,1] and offset the parameter rather than directly set to [0,1]
